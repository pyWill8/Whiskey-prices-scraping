# Whiskey-prices-scraping

In this project so far ive just scraped data off of the SWA auctions website. Going through each auctions pages and gathering the price,age, name and lot number of 
each (or most) Macallan bottles on the site. The plan in the future is to predict bottles that when released have a greater chance of larger returns and also predicting 
when bottles that have been released a while are likely to see a spike in value. I also may scrape each individuals bottles pages to get more information and clean 
with NLP later as well. The scrape gets around 50,000 bottles.
